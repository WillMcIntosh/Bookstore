# Bookstore App

Final project for Android Basics Nanodegree from Udacity. The book store uses an SQLite database and should allow the user to create, read, update, and delete books in the database.

The app makes use of the CursorAdapter class and the ContentProvider to correctly abstract database calls within the app. The application also uses `CALL_PHONE` permissions to make a phone call via an intent.
